FONTLOG for the Gyrotrope font

Overview

Gyrochrome is a wide, rounded, geometric sans-serif inspired by typefaces
of the 1960s such as Microgramma and Eurostile, as well as contemporary
takes on the genre such as Vernon Adams' Michroma
(https://github.com/vernnobile/Michroma-font).

Like Gyrochrome (https://github.com/dmoles/gyrochrome-font) — a
direct derivative of Michroma that was my first attempt at a typeface in
this genre — Gyrotrope exists because I needed a 1960s-futurist typeface
for a project, in a rounded style and a range of weights, on a DIY budget.
As I said of Gyrochrome, if you find it useful, I'm happy, but if you can
afford a real typographer you should definitely hire one.
